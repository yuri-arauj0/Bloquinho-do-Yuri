# Bloquinho do Yuri - A Simple Notepad Project
### Practicing with [PySimpleGUI](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI).

This is a wonderful library for easy and simple UIs.<br>
Using it, one can do all sorts of amazing things - such as this notepad.

I'm new to Python, been studying it for about 2 months. Really looking forward to learn more about this super easy language!

I realised that there are more GUIs out there other then PySimpleGUI, so I guess I'm going to figure them out later and maybe bring them here to GitHub too.

## Contents

I created an `.exe` file using [`pyinstaller`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17584698/getting-rid-of-console-output-when-freezing-python-programs-using-pyinstaller) writing `pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole notepad.py` in the console. <br>
It's located inside the [`dist`](https://github.com/yuri-arauj0/Bloquinho-do-Yuri/tree/main/dist) folder. I don't know what the other files mean, but the `.exe` works fine without them.

## References
I used [Israel Dryer's project](https://github.com/israel-dryer/Notepad) to add pretty much all of the functionalities a notepad should have.

## Contributions
Really, this is a very simple project, but if you know an easier way to do what Israel and I have done, let me (us) know!
