# Bloquinho do Yuri - Simple Notepad Project
Practicing with PySimpleGUI.
Using the library PySimpleGUI, one can do all sorts of amazing things - such as this notepad.

I'm new to Python, been studying it for about 2 months just for fun (at least now).

I used [Israel Dryer's project](https://github.com/israel-dryer/Notepad) to add pretty much all of the functionalities a notepad should have.
